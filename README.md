# [[Project Ideas#Make a VR Game called Kinesis| Knesis]]
---

This will be a multiplayer game where players use telekinesis to control rocks and throw them at each other like a mix between VR dodgeball and a shooter. Larger rocks can be broken down by the player for more control on whether they want a shotgun blast of rocks or one rock with high damage. The rocks can charged up and fired faster or slower. The players energy will be controlled by an energy meter. There will also be an added optional component for control using a BCI headband that measures alpha brain waves. These brain waves determine their energy level or their power level or something in-between. 

## Pitch
>Knesis is a multiplayer VR game where players use telekinesis to control rocks and throw them at each other. The game is a mix between VR dodgeball and a shooter, and larger rocks can be broken down by the player for more control. The rocks can be charged up and fired faster or slower, and the players' energy will be controlled by an energy meter. There will also be an added optional component for control using a BCI headband that measures alpha brain waves. These brain waves determine the player's energy level or power level.

## The plan to make the game is as follows: 
1. [x] Brainstorm and come up with the overall concept for the game.
 
	- The game will be set in an arena where players use their telekinetic abilities to control rocks and hurl them at each other. The objective of the game is to eliminate all of the other players. Larger rocks can be broken down into smaller ones for more control, and the rocks can be charged up and fired at different speeds. The players' energy will be controlled by an energy meter, and the optional BCI headband will allow players to control their power level with their thoughts.


2. [ ] Create a prototype of the game using Unity or another game engine. 
	1. [ ] Create the basic environment with the necessary physics and collisions  
	2. [ ] Create the player models and set up the controls. 
	3. [ ] Create the AI players
	4. [ ] Set up the BCI headband controls 
	5. [ ]  Create the rocks and the ability to throw them 
	6. [ ]  Create the energy meter and the ability to charge up the rocks 
	7. [ ]   Create the ability to break down rocks into smaller rocks
	8. [ ]   Test and debug
4. [ ] Playtest the prototype and gather feedback from players. 
5. [ ]  Incorporate feedback into the game and make changes as necessary. 
6. [ ]  Release the game on Steam or another platform. 

## Gameplay Mechanics: 
-Rocks can be charged up and fired faster or slower.

-The players energy will be controlled by an energy meter.

-There will also be an added optional component for control using a BCI headband that measures alpha brain waves. These brain waves determine their energy level or their power level or something in-between. 

## Gameplay loop:
-Players use telekinesis to control rocks and throw them at each other like a mix between VR dodgeball and a shooter.

-Larger rocks can be broken down by the player for more control on whether they want a shotgun blast of rocks or one rock with high damage. 

## Main draws for the game: 
-The unique gameplay mechanics that mix elements of VR dodgeball and a shooter. 

-The optional BCI component that adds an additional layer of control and immersion to the game.

## More ideas

there will be many different types of throwable/destructible objects such as cars, rocks, trees, and barrels. 

The player will also have a stat system which determines the amount of damage done/received by different objects.

the different destructible objects will have different ways it damages entities. (I.e: a car will explode and damage anything nearby, whereas a rock will just collide/push the thing it hits)

The environment will be completely destructible.

The player could have a “rage mode” that would greatly increase damage done/received for a short period of time. 

There would be different powerups such as invincibility, double damage, and increased fire rate. 

The game will take place in different arenas with different environmental hazards.
